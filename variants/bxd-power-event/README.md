# BXD Power Event Variant

This folder stores the branding overrides for the event-management edition of the dashboard.

## Switching from Campaign to Event Branding

1. Copy `variants/bxd-power-event/metadata.json` over the root `metadata.json`.
2. Update `index.html` and `package.json` titles/names to use the event wording (`BXD POWER EVENT - Central de Eventos`, package name `bxd-power-event`).
3. Refresh the README opening section if you want the event pitch public-facing.

Keep the main branch focused on the political campaign experience; apply these overrides in a separate Git branch or workspace when shipping the event product.
